# Flaemingo Website
Online at: https://flaemingo.de/

Website built with Gatsby for a collective of farms and small producers from Teltow-Fl√§ming with different projects aiming to rejuvenate village life. 

At the Flaemingo project, they grow organic food using permaculture principles and produce handmade wines, liqueurs, jams, soups, juices and pickled vegetables. We host company offsites, flea markets, farm tours, weekend retreats, workshops, and theatre and music evenings. We also provide space for events and personal projects, including overnight accommodation in a tiny house.

This are the first website sketches I made with Photoshop ,according to the notes and paper wireframes submited by the client and their designer:
